== Description ==
A simple WordPress plugin to extend save functionality to your keyboard outside of the general editor. This plugin lets you save your posts, pages, and custom post types in the most natural way: pressing Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac).

You can select the keyboard trigger that the action performs, by default it will save the draft or if you wish go to Settings > Writing and select the action you wish it to perform.

This plugin is [actively maintained on GitHub](http://codearachnid.github.io/wp-keyboard-save/). I welcome your pull requests, comments and suggestions for improvement.
